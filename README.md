# The Odin Project exercise: RECIPES

## Initial idea

This is a project where I'll build a "brutalist" recipe website by using CSS and HTML.  
Wondering if I'll be scaling it too.  

## TO-DO

Design a basic CSS.
For the tuna pasta: find a way to break it into its components. Refer to ./recipes/tuna-pasta.html comments for more info.

## Future ideas

With some JS magic, try the following:
Optional ingredients can be "selected", revealing optional steps for their use.
Maybe they are always dimmed out, and by selecting the relevant step on any point, you "enable" the optional procedure.

Apparently common header/footer/component is not meant to be done through HTML.
A quick google search suggested PHP and JQuery.
Maybe do it later; for now, copy pasta.
